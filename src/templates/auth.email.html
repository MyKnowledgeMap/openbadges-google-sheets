  The Google Forms add-on
  <i>OpenBadges</i> is set to run automatically when a form is submitted. The add-on was recently updated and it needs you to
  re-authorize it to run on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
  The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you re-authorize the add-on. You can accomplish this by opening
  one of the forms using the add-on and running the add-on through the menu. Alternatively, you can click this link to authorize
  the add-on directly:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="<?= authUrl ?>">Click here</a> to re-authorize the add-on.
